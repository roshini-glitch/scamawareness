    <h1>Impersonation Scam Aarthi</h1>
    <p>
      Impersonation scams involve scammers pretending to be someone trustworthy, such as government officers or bank officials, 
      to trick victims into giving money or personal information.
    </p>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Scammers call victims claiming to be from the police or bank.</li>
      <li>They create fake urgency, warning victims of crimes or fraud.</li>
      <li>Victims are asked to transfer money or provide banking details.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Avoid</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not disclose personal or bank details over the phone.</li>
      <li>Verify caller identity independently by calling official numbers.</li>
      <li>Be suspicious of urgent demands for money transfers.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Real Story:</h3>
    <p>
      A 45-year-old professional lost $50,000 after scammers impersonated police officers, claiming his identity was stolen. 
      Always verify suspicious calls independently.
