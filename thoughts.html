      <h1>Our Thoughts</h1>
      <p>Scams are no longer just about money  they impact trust, emotions, and even relationships. As technology advances, scams become harder to spot, and anyone can fall victim. That's why awareness and education are more important than ever.</p>

      <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
      <p>Every scam not only hurts individuals but also weakens our sense of safety in the community. When people fall for scams, they may feel ashamed or afraid to speak up. This silence allows scammers to continue.</p>
      <p><strong>But with awareness, we can break this cycle.</strong></p>
